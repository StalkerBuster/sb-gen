Last sync with upstream: 2019-01-12


Changes against the [upstream version](https://github.com/RPi-Dist/pi-gen.git):

- Added `stage2.1` for access point setup.

- we use a fixed set of SKIP and SKIP_IMAGE files. Therefore, we maintein a
  different `.gitigniore` file.

- `README.md` contains a different heading to tell differences from upstream.
